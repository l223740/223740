## Healthen.me

Objective: Help solve and manage complex health conditions like diabetes, multiple sclerosis, etc. Make it intuitive. 

Ideation: Patient interviews, provider interviews, literature review, industry analysis (why PHRs failed, etc.), prototying (Sketch and Principle) and testing, etc. 

Solution: 
- Automatic benefit for patients from their data
- Automatic contextualization of questions
  - Need not repeat all their conditions, circumstances, etc. every time they ask a question
  - In multi-morbidity, patients have conditions that conflict with one another (food good for diabetes can be bad for hypothyroidism, for example), very important to get all the data out and do so easily
- Easy, intuitive interaction with their data
  - PHRs (WebMD PHR, etc.) failed because inputting data feels like a lot of work
- Data analytics (upcoming)

## Sown.me

Objective: Make social beneficial and productive. Separate social from looks, vanity, etc. 

Ideation: Interviews, literature review, industry analysis, prototying (Sketch and Principle) and testing, etc. In this case, most of all, looking at my own experience. 

Solution: 
- Set a goal and a starting point
  - This provides some sense of equality regardless of who the users are. Taking 10 steps is big enough of a goal if you are an Agent Orange survivor and your starting point is being unable to walk at all. 
- Share progress or problem. 
- Get feedback. 
- The progress or problem are paired with the starting point and goal, so that helpers know the context every time they help
- Users can view their goals and all their progress, as if viewing a storybook. Each goal is a story of their lives. 
- The number of times you help and share progress/problem is made explicit to encourage your keep doing so
